# 🔗 LangChain Projects

This repository is a collection of modular and production-grade LangChain projects built with advanced tools such as Groq, FAISS, Pinecone, and Streamlit. Each project explores a different aspect of large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems for practical AI-powered applications.

## 🚀 Projects Included

### 1. 📄 Document Q&A Chatbot
Upload PDFs and ask questions directly from the content using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

- **Tech Stack:** LangChain, Groq LLM, Pinecone/FAISS, PyMuPDF
- **Highlights:** Document chunking, semantic search, vector store, Streamlit UI (optional)

---

### 2. 🧠 Code Assistant
Paste any Python code and get intelligent responses including debugging help, explanations, or refactoring suggestions.

- **Tech Stack:** LangChain, PythonREPLTool, Groq LLM
- **Highlights:** Code execution with LangChain tools, memory-based chat (optional)

---

### 3. 🧮 Math Assistant
Symbolically compute derivatives and integrals using SymPy and LangChain agents.

- **Tech Stack:** SymPy, LangChain Tools, Groq
- **Highlights:** Custom tools (`sympy_derivative`, `sympy_integral`), expression rendering in LaTeX

---

### 4. 🧑‍🔬 Autonomous Research Agent (In Progress)
Ask a research question → the agent fetches papers → parses + summarizes findings → generates citations.

- **Tech Stack:** LangChain Agents, ArXiv API, PyMuPDF, metadata-based citation generation
- **Highlights:** Multi-step planning, paper loader, citation formatting, optional UI
